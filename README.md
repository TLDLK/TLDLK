## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Noah, a student at Cedar Grove-Belgium High School.

I'm currently working on some projects for our AP Computer Science A class, notably the [codinggame.com](https;//codinggame.com) [Mad Pod Racing](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mad-pod-racing) game.

My favorite programming languages are Kotlin and Java. I also know some JS, HTML, and CSS.
